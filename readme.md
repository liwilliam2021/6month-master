# Wordle Maker

Did this on the 6hr flight to go visit my GF for our aniversary, so forgive the rushed code. Baiscally, for any string (single or multi-word) you set, this makes a solvable Wordle where the valid answer is the set string. Works just like Wordle does except with multiple words and has easily addable hints. Calls the wordnik API to check for valid words. 

# Usage

```sh
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```
